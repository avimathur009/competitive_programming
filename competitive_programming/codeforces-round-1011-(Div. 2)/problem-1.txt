GOOD THINGS:
- Identified that there we need to know only understand whether k=0 or k!=0
- Identified the 2 base cases where: 
    - s.size() == 1  -> NO
    - s[0] < s[n-1]  -> YES
- Identified that we need only 1 swap to make it "Universal"

BAD THINGS:
- Got confused how to go from logic that we only need 1 swap -> to implement to confused
- Didn't make diverse test cases
- got confused that whatever test cases I am making are diverse or not
- In that confusion -> ended up not making any test cases at all

SOLUTION:
- No matter how confused you feel in MAKING TEST CASES, *TRY* your BEST!!!!!
- This was you learn along the way that you are making correct TCs or not
    - Advantage1 : You might end up making good TCs and find the SOLUTION
    - Advantage2 : By any chance not able to find solution, learning for next contest
